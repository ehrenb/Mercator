Lines have width "NaN"
--fixed by hard-coding the width to 1, because the example js was assigning the width based on a node attribute that i didnt have (d.value)

Node links have wrong source/target  format


working :

        {
            "source": "Lru/andrey/notepad/MainActivity;",
            "target": "Lru/andrey/notepad/ObjectArrayAdapter;"
        }

solutions: make "name" in initial json be "id", rerun with stock d3 js stuff and see if it works, i think its best to keep one naming convention throughout
