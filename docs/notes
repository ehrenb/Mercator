    Mercator - the component_graph has many links between MainActivity and AddActivity, with the function link being "update".  When manual decompiling and examining with jd-gui, there is only one reference to MainActivity from AddActivity using update()
    -- good: that the link only is rendered once in D3, meaning I think that d3 won't re-render duplicated links
    -- bad: data duplication in json files means unnecessary storage
