Known issues:

See notepad.apk

    Mercator - the component_graph has many links between MainActivity and AddActivity, with the function link being "update".  When manual decompiling and examining with jd-gui, there is only one reference to MainActivity from AddActivity using update()
    -- good: that the link only is rendered once in D3, meaning I think that d3 won't re-render duplicated links
    -- bad: data duplication in json files means unnecessary storage


using G.edges(data=True) to compare attributes to dedupe linkss

todo:
    manual comparison to verify deduping is correct
    speed: back to multithreading?
    metrics: record timing and sizes for debuggin purposes
    on node selected: populate table with info in a panel 

There is another d3v3 js d3_selectable_force_directed_graph here: (updated June 2017)
