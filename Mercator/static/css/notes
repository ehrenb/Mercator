The codeflask shipped on Github that I pulled does not work with scrolling: the text scrolled into view will be transparent and not highlighted

I went to https://kazzkiq.github.io/CodeFlask.js/ and copied their live demo CSS and used that as codeflask.css and it works.

TODO: 
- Add side scrolling
- In Dendroid, MyService is still cut off some at the bottom of the editor and not highlighted


<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static',filename='css/style.css') }}">
